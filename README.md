# Minimal OT example with tycho

This is supposed to be a a minimal example for object teams compiled headless with eclipse tycho and maven. The weaving scheme should be OTDRE. The java version we need is 1.8.

On work we developing an application that uses OT. We want to create a ci where we build our application and then serve it over jenkins. Therefore we have to build it with maven, but in the process we encounter some problems. So i decided to create a minimal test example with OT and maven, were we can learn from.
